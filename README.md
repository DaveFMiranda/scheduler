# Scheduler
A one-day calendar app to schedule work events and reminders

## Description
This site is a one-day calendar. The current date is displayed at the top of the page. The user can enter text into one-hour blocks from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. The text is saved into local storage upon the user clicking the save button for that time block, and the text is loaded back onto the client upon refreshing the page. Past, present, and future time blocks appear in different colors.
